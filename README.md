# Welcome to My Skills Project Repository

This repository contains the 3D Portfolio Project, showcasing my skills through interactive 3D visualizations.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the project, you'll need to install Git and Node.js on your machine:

- [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3d-portfolio-project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd 3d-portfolio-project
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash

   ```

   This command will start the development server and open the project in your default web browser. By default, it can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can view and interact with the 3D portfolio project in your browser. Explore different visualizations and learn more about the skills displayed.
